# Monster Fog Machine remote controller

This is the firmware for our custom-made and ESP32 powered fog machine controller with a Web UI frontend. However this is no longer maintained because the MFM this was intended for self-destructed and was dismantled. Switch to V2 branch for up-to-date firmware.
